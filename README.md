# BasicInstagramClone-AndroidStudy
To learn and use Parse backend server, I created a basic instagram copy. 
In this project I learned how to upload and download stuff using Parse.
This project is just for learn how to use specific methods from Parse , ParseUser, ParsObject and ParseQuery classes with Back4App web service.
